Eden Network is devoted to minimizing the negative externalities of MEV (Miner/Maximally Extractable Value).

Simultaneously, we want to ensure that validators have access to tools that allow them to unlock the maximum value from the remaining opportunities.

Eden consists of 4 distinct (but related) products for the Ethereum ecosystem:
1. [**Eden RPC**](./eden-rpc/overview) A set of endpoints that protect Ethereum users from malicious MEV (i.e. frontrunnning, sandwich attacks)
2. [**Eden Relay**](./eden-relay/overview) A suite of tools for Ethereum validators and builders to maximize their revenue
3. [**Eden Bundles**](./eden-bundles/overview) An endpoint for sophisticated MEV searchers to submit bundles to a network of builders
4. ðŸ‘€ [**Eden Bundler**](./eden-bundler/overview) A **NEW** public alpha bundler endpoint for wallets, dApps, SDKs, and users to implement [Account Abstraction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)
