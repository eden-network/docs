Eden Relay is a suite of tools that connect validators to a network of block builders in order to maximize validator yield.  Block builders constantly compete to find the most profitable blocks to deliver to validators. 

Getting started couldn't be easier.

### For Validators
The easiest way to get started maximizing your yield as a validator/validator pool through the Eden Network is to read our [quick start guide here](./validators/quick-start)

### For Builders
If you'd like to apply to be a block builder on Eden Network, please visit our #block-builders channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZhB9mpWWG3).

Be sure to drop a message telling us a bit about yourself and why you think you would be a great addition to the network as a block builder.
