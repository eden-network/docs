description: Eden Relay connects Ethereum validators and block builders
---

Eden Relay connects Ethereum validators to a network of block builders in order to maximize validator yield.  Block builders constantly compete to find the most profitable blocks to deliver to validators. 

The relay is compatible with the MEV-Boost ecosystem and especially useful for:
* Validators who want to outsource their block production
* Block Builders who want to submit blocks to validators

## Relay Info

* Ethereum Mainnet: https://relay.edennetwork.io/info
* Goerli Testnet: https://goerli.edennetwork.io/info

## Validator Guides

Connect to Eden Relay and maximize your yield as a validator or validator pool. There are two ways to connect to the Eden Relay:

1. (Recommended) Connect to Eden Relay using MEV-Boost - [Guide](./validators/mev-boost)
2. (Not Recommended) Connect to Eden Relay using Builder API - [Guide](./validators/quick-start)

## Block Builders
