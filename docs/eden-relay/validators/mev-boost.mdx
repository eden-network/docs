title: How to Connect to Eden Relay using MEV-Boost
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

`mev-boost` is an optional add-on for validators to enable them to source blocks from multiple different relays. 
Configuring `mev-boost` is likely to increase both the profitability and reliability of your validator operation.  

:::tip Recommended

MEV-Boost is the recommended way to connect to the Eden Relay. This method enables you to connect to additional relays and helps mitigate risk.

:::

## Overview

1. Install and run `mev-boost`
2. Add Eden Relay using a command-line flag
3. Configure your consensus client to enable your `mev-boost` instance as a builder

## Spec

`mev-boost` implements the latest [Builder Specification](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs).

## Installing

`mev-boost` can run in any machine, as long as it is reachable by the beacon client. The default port is 18550. The most common setup is to install it in the same machine as the beacon client.

A single `mev-boost` instance can be used by multiple beacon nodes.

### Dependencies

- [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### From Source

Install mev-boost with `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/flashbots/mev-boost@latest
mev-boost -help
```

Or clone the repository and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost.git
cd mev-boost
make build
```

### From Docker Image

There is a public mev-boost Docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/flashbots/mev-boost

- [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Pull & run the latest image:

```bash
docker pull flashbots/mev-boost:latest
docker run flashbots/mev-boost -help
```

## Add Eden Relay URL

Once you have installed `mev-boost`, you can add Eden Relay and any other relays you wish to use. Pass the relay URLs as a comma-separated list (no spaces) to the `-relays` flag. `mev-boost` will automatically choose the most profitable block from all relays every slot.

## Configure Consensus Client
### Prysm

To use Eden Relay as your source for block production with Prysm + `mev-boost`, you simply need to add the following flag to your beacon node client to point it at your newly running `mev-boost` instance:

```mainnet
--http-mev-relay=http://localhost:18550
```

And the following to your validator client:
```
--enable-builder
```

See official [Prysm Documentations](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/advanced/builder#builder-configuration) for more details and advanced configuration options.

### Lighthouse

To use Eden Relay as your source for block production with Lighthouse + `mev-boost`, you simply need to add the following flag to your beacon node client to point it at your newly running `mev-boost` instance:
```
--builder=http://localhost:18550
```

And the following to your validator client:
```
--builder-proposals
```

See official [Lighthouse Documentation](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/builders.html) for more details and advanced configuration options.

### Teku

To use Eden Relay as your source for block production with Teku + `mev-boost` where your beacon node and validator are run in the same process, you simply need to add the following flags to your client to point it at your newly running `mev-boost` instance:
```
--validators-builder-registration-default-enabled=true 
--builder-endpoint=http://localhost:18550
```

If you are running a Teku + `mev-boost` setup where your beacon node and validator are run in different processes, your setup should look like the following:

#### Validator client:
```
teku validator-client --validators-proposer-blinded-blocks-enabled=true --validators-proposer-config="/etc/teku/proposerConfig.json"
```

#### Proposer configuration:
```json showLineNumbers
{
  "proposer_config": {
    "0xa057816155ad77931185101128655c0191bd0214c201ca48ed887f6c4c6adf334070efcd75140eada5ac83a92506dd7a": {
      "fee_recipient": "0x50155530FCE8a85ec7055A5F8b2bE214B3DaeFd3",
    }
  },
  "default_config": {
    "fee_recipient": "0x6e35733c5af9B61374A128e6F85f553aF09ff89A",
    "builder": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Beacon node:
```
teku --validators-proposer-default-fee-recipient="0x6e35733c5af9B61374A128e6F85f553aF09ff89A" --ee-endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:8551" --ee-jwt-secret-file="/etc/jwt-secret.hex" --builder-endpoint="http://localhost:18550"
```

See official [Teku Documentation](https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/HowTo/Builder-Network/) for more details and advanced configuration options.

### Lodestar

To use Eden Relay as your source for block production with Lodestar + mev-boost, you simply need to add the following flag to your beacon node client to point it at your newly running mev-boost instance:

```bash
--builder --builder.urls http://localhost:18550
```

#### Validator client:

```bash
--builder --suggestedFeeRecipient <your ethereum address>
```

See official [Lodestar Documentation](https://chainsafe.github.io/lodestar/usage/mev-integration/#lodestar-and-builder-api) for more details and advanced configuration options.

### Nimbus

To use Eden Relay as your source for block production with Nimbus + mev-boost, you simply need to add the following flag to your beacon node client to point it at your newly running mev-boost instance:

```bash
./run-mainnet-beacon-node.sh --payload-builder=true --payload-builder-url=http://localhost:18550
```

#### Validator client:

```bash

```

See official [Nimbus Documentation](https://nimbus.guide/external-block-builder.html) for more details and advanced configuration options.
