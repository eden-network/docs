`mev-boost` is an optional add-on for validators to enable them to source blocks from multiple different relays. 
Configuring `mev-boost` is likely to increase both the profitability and reliability of your validator operation.  

It is the recommended method for connecting to Eden Relay.

-----
## Spec

`mev-boost` implements the latest [Builder Specification](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs).

## Installing

`mev-boost` can run in any machine, as long as it is reachable by the beacon client. The default port is 18550. The most common setup is to install it in the same machine as the beacon client.

### Dependencies

- [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### From source

Install mev-boost with `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/flashbots/mev-boost@latest
mev-boost -help
```

Or clone the repository and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost.git
cd mev-boost
make build
```

### From Docker image

There is a public mev-boost Docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/flashbots/mev-boost

- [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Pull & run the latest image:

```bash
docker pull flashbots/mev-boost:latest
docker run flashbots/mev-boost -help
```

## Usage

A single `mev-boost` instance can be used by multiple beacon nodes. To connect `mev-boost` to multiple relays, pass the relay URLs as a comma-separated list (no spaces) to the `-relay` flag. 
`mev-boost` will automatically choose the most profitable block from all relays every slot.

## Configure Consensus Client
### Prysm

To use Eden Relay as your source for block production with Prysm + `mev-boost`, you simply need to add the following flag to your beacon node client to point it at your newly running `mev-boost` instance:

```mainnet
--http-mev-relay=http://localhost:18550
```

And the following to your validator client:
```
--enable-builder
```

### Lighthouse

To use Eden Relay as your source for block production with Lighthouse + `mev-boost`, you simply need to add the following flag to your beacon node client to point it at your newly running `mev-boost` instance:
```
--builder=http://localhost:18550
```

And the following to your validator client:
```
--builder-proposals
```

See official [Lighthouse Documentation](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/builders.html) for more details and advanced configuration options.
