## Summary

Historical dataset of MEV-Blocker transactions collected from Gnosis. MEV-Blocker is an orderflow auction which includes decoy transactions.

## Process

We ETL data from MEV-Blocker, store and make the data available in BigQuery. Our dataset contains public information provided by the API about the orderflow.

## BigQuery

By making the data available in BigQuery, it can be queried and joined with other public datasets, like the Ethereum Blockchain dataset or simply exported.
