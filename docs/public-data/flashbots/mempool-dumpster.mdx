## Summary

Historical dataset of mempool dumpster transactions.

## Process

We ETL data from the [mempool dumpster &nearr;](https://github.com/flashbots/mempool-dumpster), store and make the data available in BigQuery. Our dataset contains public information provided by the mempool dumpster.

## BigQuery

By making the data available in BigQuery, it can be queried and joined with other public datasets, like the Ethereum Blockchain dataset or simply exported.

* Dataset: `eden-data-public.flashbots` [Open in BigQuery &nearr;](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=eden-data-public&d=flashbots&page=dataset)
* Table: `eden-data-public.flashbots.mempool_dumpster` [Open in BigQuery &nearr;](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=eden-data-public&d=flashbots&t=mempool_dumpster&page=table)
* Update frequency: 24 hours
