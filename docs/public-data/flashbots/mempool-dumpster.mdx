## Summary

Historical dataset of mempool dumpster transactions.

## Process

We ETL data from the [mempool dumpster](https://github.com/flashbots/mempool-dumpster), store and make the data available in BigQuery. Our dataset contains public information provided by the mempool dumpster.

## BigQuery

By making the data available in BigQuery, it can be queried and joined with other public datasets, like the Ethereum Blockchain dataset or simply exported.

* Dataset: `eden-data-public.flashbots`
* Table: `eden-data-public.flashbots.mempool_dumpster`
* Update frequency: 24 hours
* Partitioning: Daily

## Example Query

You can get started with the example query below.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `eden-data-public.flashbots.mempool_dumpster` 
WHERE DATE(block_timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE()
```

:::tip Working with Partioned Tables

You should usually use a WHERE clause on partitioned data to save on query costs. [Learn more](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables)
