description: Public dataset of MEV-Boost block builder bids
---

## Summary

Historical dataset of MEV-Boost block builder bids collected from known MEV-Boost relays.

## Process

We ETL data from MEV-Boost Relays from the endpoint `/builder_blocks_received`, store and make the data available in BigQuery. Our dataset contains public information provided by each relay from their API.
* Relays:
  * Flashbots
  * Eden Network
  * Ultrasound
  * Aestus
  * Agnostic
  * Manifold
  * BloxrouteMaxProfit
  * BloxrouteRegulated
* We augment data to determine if blocks have been re-orged
* We augment data with block timestamp
* [MEV-Boost Relay Reference &nearr;](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/blob/98576112e245454a225e9a668cacfa498eea00b4/services/api/service.go#L71)

## BigQuery

By making the data available in BigQuery, it can be queried and joined with other public datasets, like the Ethereum Blockchain dataset or simply exported.

## Example Query

You can get started with the example query below.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `eden-data-public.mev_boost.bids` 
WHERE DATE(block_timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE()
```

:::tip Working with Partioned Tables

You should usually use a WHERE clause on partitioned data to save on query costs. [Learn more](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables)
