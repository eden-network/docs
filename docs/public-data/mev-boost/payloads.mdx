title: MEV-Boost Payloads

## Summary

Historical dataset of MEV-Boost block payloads delivered collected from known MEV-Boost relays.

## Process

We ETL data from MEV-Boost Relays from the endpoint `/payloads`, store and make the data available in BigQuery. Our dataset contains public information provided by each relay from their API.
* Relays: Flashbots, Eden, Ultrasound, Aestus, Agnostic, ...

## BigQuery

By making the data available in BigQuery, it can be queried and joined with other public datasets, like the Ethereum Blockchain dataset or simply exported.

* Dataset: `eden-data-public.mev_boost`
* Table: `eden-data-public.mev_boost.payloads`
* Update frequency: 60 mins
* Partitioning: Daily

## Example Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `eden-data-public.mev_boost.payloads` 
WHERE DATE(block_timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE()

```

:::tip Working with Partioned Tables

You should usually use a WHERE clause on partitioned data to save on query costs. [Learn more](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables)
