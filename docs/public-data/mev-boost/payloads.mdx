title: MEV-Boost Payloads
description: Public dataset of MEV-Boost block payloads delivered
---

## Summary

Historical dataset of MEV-Boost block payloads delivered collected from known MEV-Boost relays.

## Process

We ETL data from MEV-Boost Relays from the endpoint `/proposer_payload_delivered`, store and make the data available in BigQuery. Our dataset contains public information provided by each relay from their API.
* Relays:
  * Flashbots
  * Eden Network
  * Ultrasound
  * Aestus
  * Agnostic
  * Manifold
  * BloxrouteMaxProfit
  * BloxrouteRegulated
* [MEV-Boost Relay Reference &nearr;](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/blob/98576112e245454a225e9a668cacfa498eea00b4/services/api/service.go#L70)

## BigQuery

By making the data available in BigQuery, it can be queried and joined with other public datasets, like the Ethereum Blockchain dataset or simply exported.

* Dataset: `eden-data-public.mev_boost` [Open in BigQuery &nearr;](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=eden-data-public&d=mev_boost&t=bids&page=dataset)
* Table: `eden-data-public.mev_boost.payloads` [Open in BigQuery &nearr;](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=eden-data-public&d=mev_boost&t=payloads&page=table)
* Update frequency: 60 mins
* Partitioning: Daily

## Example Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `eden-data-public.mev_boost.payloads` 
WHERE DATE(block_timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE()

```

:::tip Working with Partioned Tables

You should usually use a WHERE clause on partitioned data to save on query costs. [Learn more](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables)
