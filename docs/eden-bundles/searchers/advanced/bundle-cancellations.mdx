description: Learn how to replace and cancel bundles

Eden supports replacing and cancelling bundles by passing a standard [UUIDv4](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) identifier as an optional parameter with your bundles. 
To use this feature send your bundles to the same RPC endpoint used for normal bundles: `https://api.edennetwork.io/v1/bundle` using this parameter as described below.

### Unique Identifier for Bundles

Bundles can be replaced and canceled using a unique identifier (`replacementUuid`) assigned to a bundle at the time of submission.

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      txs,
      blockNumber,
      replacementUuid, // UUIDv4 to uniquely identify submission
    }
  ]
}
```

### Replace a Bundle

Submit your new replacement bundle with the same `replacementUuid` value in order to replace a bundle.

* Use the same method `eth_sendBundle`.
* Use the same value for `replacementUuid` as the original bundle you wish to replace.

Your original bundle MUST have been sent with a `replacementUuid` specified.

### Cancel a Bundles

Call the method [`eth_cancelBundle`](/eden-bundles/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_cancelbundle) in order to cancel a bundle. Or use the `cancelBundle` function in your preferred [Flashbots library](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/libraries/ethers-js-provider).

Your bundle MUST have been sent with a `replacementUuid` specified.

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_cancelBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      replacementUuid, // UUIDv4 to uniquely identify submission
    }
  ]
}
```
