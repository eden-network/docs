title: Bundle Cancellations
---

Eden now supports replacing and cancelling bundles by passing a standard [UUIDv4](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) identifier as an optional parameter with your bundles. 
To use this feature send your bundles to the same RPC endpoint used for normal bundles: `https://api.edennetwork.io/v1/bundle` using this parameter as described below.

### Understanding bundle cancellations

Bundles can be replaced and canceled using a unique identifier (`replacementUuid`) assigned to a bundle at the time of submission.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      txs,
      blockNumber,
      minTimestamp,
      maxTimestamp,
      revertingTxHashes,
      replacementUuid, // UUIDv4 to uniquely identify submission
    }
  ]
}
```

### Replacing bundles

To replace a bundle, send the new bundle via `eth_sendBundle` with the same `replacementUuid` as the bundle you want to replace.

### Canceling bundles

Canceling a bundle will prevent Eden builders from including it on-chain. To cancel a bundle, call the [`eth_cancelBundle`](/eden-bundles/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_cancelbundle) endpoint, or use the `cancelBundle` function in your preferred [Flashbots library](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/libraries/ethers-js-provider).

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_cancelBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      replacementUuid, // UUIDv4 to uniquely identify submission
    }
  ]
}
```
