description: Send bundles to Eden's network of block builders using the `eth_sendBundle` RPC.
---

The Eden RPC supports sending bundles directly to Eden's network of block builders.

* Endpoint: `https://api.edennetwork.io/v1/bundle`
* [Technical specification](/eden-bundles/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint)

## Bundle Submission

If you are already familiar with bundle submission, send your bundles to the endpoint above. The endpoint supports:

* Target block, min and max timestamps
* Reverting transactions
* [Bundle cancellation](/eden-bundles/searchers/advanced/bundle-cancellations)

```ts showLineNumbers
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      txs: string[],                // List of signed transactions to execute in an atomic bundle
      blockNumber: string,          // Hex encoded block number for which this bundle is valid on
      minTimestamp?: number,        // (Optional) The minimum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch
      maxTimestamp?: number,        // (Optional) The maximum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch
      revertingTxHashes?: string[], // (Optional) List of tx hashes that are allowed to revert
      replacementUuid?: string,     // (Optional) UUID that can be used to cancel/replace this bundle
    }
  ]
}
```

## About Bundles

Bundles are especially useful for Ethereum users who prefer to bypass the public mempool and optionally bundle multiple transactions together with various inclusion criteria. For example,

* Searchers looking for fast, and risk free access to blockspace (for example, arbitrage and liquidation bot operators)
* Users looking for frontrunning protection on their transactions (see also: [Eden RPC](/eden-rpc/overview))
* Dapps with advanced use cases like account abstraction or gasless transactions (see also: [Eden Bundler (ERC-4337)](/eden-bundler/overview))

Transactions submitted as bundles obtain pre-trade "privacy" or "confidentiality" as the transactions are not shared with the public mempool.

As such, for a bundle to be included, there is a sealed-bid auction for transaction inclusion with bids paid in gas, or [direct eth transfer to the coinbase address](/eden-bundles/searchers/advanced/coinbase-payment).

:::tip Conditional Payments
Using direct payments instead of gas price allows users to make payments conditional on their transaction succeeding, thus avoiding having to pay for failed bids.

## Example Bundle

Bundles consist of one or more transactions that are executed in the order they are provided.

Consider a searcher who wants to backrun a transaction from the mempool in the next block. They create a `signedBundle` consisting of:
1. Target tx: `SIGNED_ORACLE_UPDATE_FROM_PENDING_POOL`
2. Backrun tx: `transaction`

The `signedBundle` is then submitted using the next block as the `targetBlockMumber`.


```js showLineNumbers
const signedBundle = flashbotsProvider.signBundle(
    [
      {
        signedTransaction: SIGNED_ORACLE_UPDATE_FROM_PENDING_POOL // serialized signed transaction hex
      },
      {
        signer: wallet, // ethers signer
        transaction: transaction // ethers populated transaction object
      }
    ])
const bundleReceipt = await flashbotsProvider.sendRawBundle(
    signedBundle, // bundle we signed above
    targetBlockNumber // block number at which this bundle is valid
  )
)
```
