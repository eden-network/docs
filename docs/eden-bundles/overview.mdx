Eden supports an `eth_sendBundle` RPC which allows sophisticated Ethereum users called "searchers" to send "bundles" to Eden's network of block builders.

Bundles include an array of arbitrary signed Ethereum transactions along with some metadata describing under what conditions these transactions should be included.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      txs,               // Array[String], A list of signed transactions to execute in an atomic bundle
      blockNumber,       // String, a hex encoded block number for which this bundle is valid on
      minTimestamp,      // (Optional) Number, the minimum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch
      maxTimestamp,      // (Optional) Number, the maximum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch
      revertingTxHashes, // (Optional) Array[String], A list of tx hashes that are allowed to revert
    }
  ]
}
```

### Searchers
Searchers are Ethereum users who, for whatever reason, prefer to use the Eden private transaction pool over the regular p2p transaction pool. These users monitor the state of the chain and send bundles to relayers.

Typically, searchers will be one of the following types:
1. Ethereum bot operators looking for fast, and risk free access to blockspace (for example, arbitrage and liquidation bots)
2. Ethereum users looking for frontrunning protection on their transactions (for example, Uniswap traders)
3. Ethereum Dapps with advanced use cases like account abstraction or gasless transactions (for example, tornado.cash and mistX)

By submitting bundles directly to relayers instead of through the p2p network, searchers obtain `Pre-trade privacy` as their transactions cannot be seen by the rest of the network. The searchers express their bids for inclusion through their ethereum transactions as either gas price, or direct eth transfer to the coinbase address. Using direct payments instead of gas price allows users to make payments conditional on their transaction succeeding, thus avoiding having to pay for failed bids.

See the [searcher quick-start guide](/eden-bundles/searchers/quick-start) to learn how to get started.
