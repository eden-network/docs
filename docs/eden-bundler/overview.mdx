# Eden Bundler

Eden is launching an [ERC-4337-compliant](./erc4337-overview) bundler for wallets, dapps, and users. 

Devs can expect a seamless integration and world-class infrastructure to support their account abstraction projects.

Users can expect better UX, more privacy/protection for their transactions, and, oh yeah, FREE TRADES!

Our public alpha endpoint is now live at:
```
https://bundler-goerli.edennetwork.io
```

Additional documentation + other networks coming soon!

For now, we recommend anyone interested in getting started with account abstraction read through the [excellent Stackup documentation](https://docs.stackup.sh/docs/guides/quickstart). 

Be sure to set [https://bundler-goerli.edennetwork.io](https://bundler-goerli.edennetwork.io) as your bundlerUrl on Goerli!
