title: Rate Limiting
---

We have rate limits on the number of requests that can be made to Eden RPC and Eden Rocket RPC in order to protect our service from abuse. Currently you can only make 100 requests per second.

Note that this is *requests* per second and not *transactions* submitted per second. The number of transactions in a request is not limited.
