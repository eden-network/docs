title: Speed RPC
---

Eden Speed RPC offers endpoints in three major global locations, reducing the distance between transaction origin and RPC location. Users can reduce their first-hop latency and use Eden Network’s speed-optimized global infrastructure for transaction propagation.


## Using Speed RPC

To add Speed RPC endpoint follow these steps:

1. Enter your MetaMask and click on your RPC endpoint at the top of your MetaMask. By default it says “Ethereum mainnet.”
2. Click “Custom RPC”
3. Add `http://speed-us-east.edennetwork.io` (or any of the below RPCs, depending on your location) with a chainID of `1` and currency of `ETH`.
4. Scroll to the bottom and click “Save”

## Speed RPC Locations

http://speed-us-east.edennetwork.io - US East  
http://speed-eu-west.edennetwork.io - EU West  
http://speed-tokyo.edennetwork.io - Tokyo  

More regional endpoints may be added in the future.
