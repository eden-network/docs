title: Speed RPC
---

Eden Speed RPC features multiple RPCs endpoints throughout the world, each of them publicly accessible, meaning that a typical transaction using Eden Speed RPC will be propagated faster than competing RPCs.


## Using Speed RPC

To add Speed RPC endpoint follow these steps:

1. Enter your MetaMask and click on your RPC endpoint at the top of your MetaMask. By default it says “Ethereum mainnet.”
2. Click “Custom RPC”
3. Add `http://speed-us-east.edennetwork.io` (or any of the below RPCs, depending on your location) with a chainID of `1` and currency of `ETH`.
4. Scroll to the bottom and click “Save”

## Speed RPC Locations

http://speed-us-east.edennetwork.io - US East
http://speed-eu-west.edennetwork.io - EU West
http://speed-tokyo.edennetwork.io - Tokyo

More regional endpoints may be added in the future.
