title: How to Subscribe via WebSockets
description: This page is a guide to subscribing to Ethereum Mempool transactions using WebSockets.
---

## Overview

You can connect to the stream using a WebSockets subscription. As new transactions are detected in the mempool, they will be pushed directly to you for you to handle.

1. Connect with a WebSockets library to an endpoint
2. Send a subscription message
3. Wait for incoming messages
4. Handle incoming messages

## Early Access

:::tip Early Access
The service is currently in alpha.

If you would like access, [join our Discord channel `#mempool-service`](https://discord.gg/98GV73f)
:::

## Subscription Parameters

`params`: Required:

* Type: `"newTxs" | "rawTxs"`

### Subscribing to Parsed Transactions

Use `newTxs` for parsed results.

```json showLineNumbers
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "subscribe",
    // highlight-next-line
    "params": ["newTxs"]
}
```

### Subscribing to RLP Encoded Transactions

Use `rawTxs` for RLP encoded results.

:::note More about RLP
You can read more about RLP serialization on [Ethereum's dev docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/)

Popular libraries like [viem](https://viem.sh/docs/utilities/fromRlp.html) and [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/encoding/#utils.rlpDecode) offer utilities to help handle decoding
:::

```json showLineNumbers
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "subscribe",
    // highlight-next-line
    "params": ["rawTxs"]
}
```

## What's Next

Once you have subscribed, you will receive new messages containing new transactions. From here, you may want to filter, validate, simulate, bundle, log or otherwise handle those transactions within your application logic.
